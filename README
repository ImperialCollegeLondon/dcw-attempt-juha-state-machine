In August 2018, Juha Aaltonen on LinkedIn's Plain Old C Programming
group asked about state machines and "forward enums".  I said:
use plain integers:-)  Then he posted some "proof of concept" code,
incomplete and not compilable, and not completely clear even so, so I
thought I'd try my idea out, even though some concepts in his code were
not clear to me (in particular his idea of transition functions, and he
also seemed to have an entirely missing concept of "here's the stream of
events that actually occur as the state machine is running")..

That didn't work, so I thought I'd try Nigel's idea: use strings not integers
(for states and actions), and add my own twist: map these strings to
integers internally so that the internal data structures can be very efficient
arrays of structs, using a state no or action no as the index.

part4 gets it working properly, although Juha has now provided more information
about what transition functions are - and they're NOT what I thought of, and
so implemented.  Ah well.
